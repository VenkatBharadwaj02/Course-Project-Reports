Geodesics around the black hole can be used to describe important features of the space
time. This paper discusses studying the geodesic of Schwarzchild black hole using its Jacobi
metric and determines the stability of the same using lyapunov exponents in the same
metric. The later part of this paper shows the relation between the quasi-normal modes of
the black hole and lyapunov exponents, and thus gives a relation between the unstable null
geodesic and the quasi-normal mode of the black hole.
