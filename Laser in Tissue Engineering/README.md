# Abstract
In this paper, we reviewed laser assisted biofabrication techniques such as the use of laser tweezers to
trap individual cells, laser initiated polymerization techniques that uses non-linear optical effects to
generate chemical bonds, LIFT and MAPLE that is used to deposit polymeric material onto substrate,
and finally laser ablation techniques for biomaterial removal. We have seen that these techniques prove
to be very useful techniques in tissue engineering due to their noninvasive, material independent, and
highly precise nature. These systems, albeit not at the level of organ construction, can be used to
mimic various biological system in laboratory conditions and can be used to study their properties.
