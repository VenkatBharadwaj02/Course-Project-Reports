# Abstract
In this paper, we have seen the principles behind the implementation of an ion trap
quantum computer. It passes all 5 of Di Vincenzoâ€™s criteria i.e Qubit initialization, Single
Qubit Measurement, Universality, Coherence Time, Scalability. Due to the fact that ions
can be trapped and manipulated with great control, we have been able to achieve high
level of precision and accuracy through ion trap quantum computing. However, there are
still many challenges to overcome in order to scale up this system to a level where we can
use it for practical applications. Despite these challenges many technological companies
and institutions are researching on making these computers more practical and feasible.
