# Abstract
In this paper, the analytical calculation for photon shadows around a black hole are reviewed.
In particular, the propagation of photons in Schwarzschild metric and Kerr metric are studied to
calculate the shadow. These calculations are used to derive the angular size of the shadow in these
space-times. It also compares these shadows for various parameters such as the observer distance
and spin parameter. A general method to outline a photon orbit in a generic space-time is stated.
This paper also describes current status and the further scope of research in this topic.
