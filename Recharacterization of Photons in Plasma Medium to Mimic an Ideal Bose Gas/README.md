# Abstract
The properties of a Bose Einstein condensate are discussed and we see the role of chemical
potential for the same. The thermodynamical properties of a plasma-photon system have also been
studied using a statistical physics approach. Photons in a plasma medium acquire an effective mass
due to the presence of a finite chemical potential, with all these modified properties of a photon
in a different medium, it can also be proved that the Planckâ€™s law of black body radiation is also
modified where we observe a point of criticality that was previously absent for a photon without an
effective mass. We also see how this very critical point is relevant in the context of Bose Einstein
Condensates (BECs) which has also been experimentally realized in recent years.
