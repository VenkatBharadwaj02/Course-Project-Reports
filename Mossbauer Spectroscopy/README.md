# Abstract
This paper is a review article on the principles and applications of Mossbauer Spectroscopy.
Rudolph Mossbauer, while working on his thesis paper, discovered the recoil-less absorption of
γ rays. This phenomenon developed into a spectroscopic technique known as Mossbauer spectroscopy.
This technique is used to measure hyperfine interaction in the nucleus. These hyperfine
interactions are strongly dependent on the nucleus’s neighbouring environment. Thus, this technique
has been used in various fields to study the electric and magnetic structur of given sample.
