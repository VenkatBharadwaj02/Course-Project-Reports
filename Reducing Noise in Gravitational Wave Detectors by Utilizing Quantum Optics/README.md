# Abstract
Einsten’s General Theory of Relativity predicts the existence of gravitational waves, which
are the ripples of spacetime. However, detecting these waves require very sensitive instruments
which can detect a change in mechanical energy of 10−32J. These detectors are based on the
principles of Michelson interferometer. The change in the arm length of the detectors during
a gravitational wave event would produce changes in the interference pattern. The reason for
low frequency of detecting such events is because the amplitude of signature of gravitational
waves are far less than the zero point fluctuations. We discuss here about the sources of various
noise in gravitational wave detectors. To improve the accuracy in detecting such events, we can
couple the mechanical motion of test mass to optical field through an optomechanical coupling.
We discuss about squeezed states of light and its application in improving the accuracy of
detectors. At last, we have considered the use of optomechanical interaction to dilute the effect
of thermal noise through optical dilution scheme and to narrow the bandwidth of a filter cavity
for frequency dependent squeezing.
